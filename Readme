Here I am trying to solve 3 problems/Attacks on Elgg blogs

1. get cookie alert
2. get cookie value and capture in terminal
3. get timestamp and token value
4. add blog post who ever visits the post
5. add friend whoever visits the post
6. Self propagating

I used JavaScript and AJAX

AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

AJAX is not a programming language.

AJAX just uses a combination of:

A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

< &lt;
